This is the Comp1004 Module project for my first year university coursework.

this code has two sections, the first of which being a password manager and the second of which being a random password generator

make sure you run the code using an application that supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript

the password Generator is fully operational but the Password Generator only allows you to store one password at a time as of this moment
- this is something that is being worked upon so a fix is inbound

please enjoy Connor's Passvault and generator!
